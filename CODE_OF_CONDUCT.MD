# ðŸ“œ Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the GYM One project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and respectful community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Showing empathy toward others  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and public communication channels (e.g., GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, Discord, etc.), and it also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
